        <h2>About Ukulele</h2>
        <p>The ukulele is a small, guitar-like instrument, which was introduced to Hawaii by Portuguese immigrants from Madeira. It gained great popularity elsewhere in the United States during the early 20th century, and from there spread internationally.</p>
        <p>The tone and volume of the instrument vary with size and construction. Ukuleles commonly come in four sizes: soprano, concert, tenor, and baritone.</p>
        <p>The ukulele is typically made of four nylon or gut strings or sequences of strings, some of which may be harmonized in courses. Many famed artists like Eddie Vedder and Jason Mraz have used this instrument to enrich their classical songs. </p>
        <p>The uke provides an excellent starting point for music students and amateur musicians. Musicians of any age can quickly learn to play this instrument. The ukulele is available in four different sizes with different pitches, tones, fretboards, and tunes.</p>
        <h3>History of the Ukulele</h3>
        <p>The ukulele has a rich history and tradition. While this instrument first appeared in Hawaii in the eighteenth century, its roots are found in Portugal. However, it is not known as to who actually invented the uke. Despite this, the story of how this instrument rose to popularity is an exciting one. </p>
        <p>Historians agree that the Portuguese braguinha or machete de braga is the instrument that led to the creation of the ukulele. The braguinha is a small instrument as compared to the guitar but operates quite similar to the first four stringers of the guitar. </p>
        <p>On the other hand, the ukulele has the same scale length as the machete but is tuned GCEA instead of DGBD. In other words, we can say that the Hawaiians nicknamed the braguinha as ukulele. Let’s see how this happened.</p>
        <p>By the mid-eighteenth century, Hawaii’s sugar industry was booming, which created a shortage of workforce in the area. At the same time, Portugal was experiencing economic collapse. The economic downturn forced many Portuguese to immigrate to Hawaii to find employment opportunities in the sugar industry. </p>
        <p>Many Portuguese arrived in Hawaii along with their families and machetes. Among them were three woodworkers named Manuel Nunes, Augusto Dias, and Jose do Espirito (originally from Madeira’s port city, Funchal). A man named Joao Fernandes was also among the passengers. He played the machete and sang a thanksgiving song upon arrival at the Honolulu Harbor on August 23, 1879. </p>
        <p>Fernandes’s performance moved the Hawaiians so much so that it made them obsessed with the branguinha. The Hawaiians nicknamed the instrument as the "ukulele," which means “jumping flea.’ This term refers to the way Fernandes’ fingers moved on the fretboard. </p>
        <p>Many Portuguese immigrants lived in Hawaii, but Nunes, Dias, and Santos traveled to Honolulu to find work upon the completion of their contractual employment in Hawaii. They started woodwork and instruments making business in Honolulu. Their efforts further promoted the ukulele.</p>
        <p>It is not clear as to who made the first ukulele. What we know is that it went from Portugal to Hawaii as a branguinha. Once in Hawaii and Honolulu, the machete changed in size and shape and got reentrant tuning that gave the ukulele its exclusive sound and ease of playability.</p>
        <p>The Hawaiian king David Kalakauna was in love with the ukulele. He introduced the instrument into the Hawaiian music of that time, providing the instrument the backing of the royalty. This move made the ukulele an inseparable part of the Hawaiian music tradition. </p>
        <p>While the popularity of the ukulele began to vane with the start of rock and roll in the 1950s, it has made a successful comeback in modern times. Ukulele sales saw a sharp spike in the United States between 2009 and 2018. Figures by Statista show that 1.77 million ukulele were sold in the US from 2009 to 2018. The popularity of the ukulele is expected to rise in the coming years.</p>
        <h3>Types and sizes</h3>
        <p>Common types of ukuleles include soprano (standard ukulele), concert, tenor, and baritone. Less common are the sopranino (also called piccolo, bambino, or "pocket uke"), bass, and contrabass ukuleles.[38] Other types of ukuleles include banjo ukuleles and electric ukuleles. Of the standard ukuleles, the soprano, often called "standard" in Hawaii, is the second-smallest and was the original size. The concert size was developed in the 1920s as an enhanced soprano, slightly larger and louder with a deeper tone. Shortly thereafter, the tenor was created, having more volume and deeper bass tone. The baritone (resembling a smaller tenor guitar) was created in the 1940s, and the contrabass and bass are recent innovations (2010 and 2014, respectively).</p>

        <h3>Tuning</h3>
        <p>One of the most common tunings for the standard or soprano ukulele is C<sup>6</sup> tuning: G<sup>4</sup>–C<sup>4</sup>–E<sup>4</sup>–A<sup>4</sup>, which is often remembered by the notes in the "My dog has fleas" jingle (see sidebar). The G string is tuned an octave higher than might be expected, so this is often called "high G" tuning. This is known as a "reentrant tuning"; it enables uniquely close-harmony chording.</p>
        <p>More rarely used with the soprano ukulele is C<sup>6</sup> linear tuning, or "low G" tuning, which has the G in sequence an octave lower: G<sup>3</sup>–C<sup>4</sup>–E<sup>4</sup>–A<sup>4</sup>, which is equivalent to playing the top four strings (DGBE) of a guitar with a capo on the fifth fret.</p>
        <p>Another common tuning for the soprano ukulele is the higher string-tension D <sup>6</sup>tuning (or simply D tuning), A<sup>4</sup>–D<sup>4</sup>–F♯<sup>4</sup>–B<sup>4</sup>, one step higher than the G<sup>4</sup>–C<sup>4</sup>–E<sup>4</sup>–A<sup>4</sup> tuning. Once considered standard, this tuning was commonly used during the Hawaiian music boom of the early 20th century, and is often seen in sheet music from this period, as well as in many method books through the 1980s. D<sup>6</sup> tuning is said by some to bring out a sweeter tone in some ukuleles, generally smaller ones. D<sup>6</sup> tuning with a low fourth string, A<sup>3</sup>–D<sup>4</sup>–F♯<sup>4</sup>–B<sup>4</sup>, is sometimes called "Canadian tuning" after its use in the Canadian school system, mostly on concert or tenor ukuleles, and extensive use by James Hill and J. Chalmers Doane.</p>
        <p>Whether C<sup>6</sup> or D<sup>6</sup> tuning should be the "standard" tuning is a matter of long and ongoing debate. There are historic and popular ukulele methods that have used each.</p>
        <p>For the concert and tenor ukuleles, both reentrant and linear C<sup>6</sup> tunings are standard; linear tuning in particular is widely used for the tenor ukulele, more so than for the soprano and concert instruments.</p>
        <p>The baritone ukulele usually uses linear G6 tuning: D<sup>3</sup>–G<sup>3</sup>–B<sup>3</sup>–E<sup>4</sup>, the same as the highest four strings of a standard 6-string guitar.</p>
        <p>Bass ukuleles are tuned similarly to bass guitars: E<sup>1</sup>–A<sup>1</sup>–D<sup>2</sup>–G<sup>2</sup> for U-Bass style instruments (sometimes called contrabass), or an octave higher, E<sup>2</sup>–A<sup>2</sup>–D<sup>3</sup>–G<sup>3</sup>, for Ohana type metal-string basses. E-A-D-G is also the same tuning as a double bass (the only bowed chordophone tuned to perfect fourths rather than perfect fifths as is the case with all other instruments in its class), or the first four strings of a standard guitar.</p>
        <p>Sopranino ukulele tuning is less standardized. They usually are tuned re-entrantly, but frequently at a higher pitch than C; for example, re-entrant G6 tuning: D<sup>5</sup>–G<sup>4</sup>–B<sup>4</sup>–E<sup>5</sup>.</p>
        <p>As is commonly the case with string instruments, other tunings may be preferred by individual players. For example, special string sets are available to tune the baritone ukulele in linear C<sup>6</sup> . Some players tune ukuleles like other four-string instruments such as the mandolin, Venezuelan cuatro, or dotara. Ukuleles may also be tuned to open tunings, similar to the Hawaiian slack key style.</p>
        <h3>Related instruments</h3>
        <p>Ukulele varieties include hybrid instruments such as the guitalele (also called guitarlele), banjo ukulele (also called banjolele), harp ukulele, lap steel ukulele, and the ukelin. It is very common to find ukuleles mixed with other stringed instruments because of the amount of strings and the easy playing ability. There is also an electrically amplified variant of the ukulele. The resonator ukulele produces sound by one or more spun aluminum cones (resonators) instead of the wooden soundboard, giving it a distinct and louder tone. The Tahitian ukulele, another variant, is usually carved from a single piece of wood,and does not have a hollow soundbox, although the back is open. The Tahitian ukulele generally has eight strings made from fishing line, tuned the same as a Hawaiian ukulele in four courses, although the middle two courses are an octave higher than its Hawaiian cousin. Inspired by the Tahitian ukulele, there is the Motu Iti and Nui variants, from France, which have just four strings made from fishing line and the hole in the back is designed to produce a wah-wah effect.</p>
        <p>Close cousins of the ukulele include the Portuguese forerunners, the cavaquinho (also commonly known as machete or braguinha) and the slightly larger rajão. Other relatives include the Venezuelan cuatro, the Colombian tiple, the timple of the Canary Islands, the Spanish vihuela, the Mexican requinto jarocho, and the Andean charango traditionally made of an armadillo shell. In Indonesia, a similar Portuguese-inspired instrument is the kroncong.</p>
